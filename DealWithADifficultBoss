Deal with a Difficult Boss in English

  - Breathe & buy yourself time
  
  - Lead with your endpoint
  
  - Embrace the power of writing
     you might feel frustrated and others listening to you might feel frustrated or impatient as well
     if you're feeling anxious or you don't yet the confidence you need to clearly articulate your thoughts and it's appropriate
       you can always request to share your thoughts in writing
  
     Eg. "I would love to give you a clear picture and explain my thoughts in detail.
         Do you mind if I do that in writing and get back to you by email this afternoon?"
         
   1. Just to clarify, you're asking me to ...
   2. I'd like to make sure I understand you clearly. You said ...
   3. I'd like to go back to something you said a moment ago.
      Could you explain what you meant by ...?
   
   - Reframe the conversation
     Eg. "Okay Susan, that sounds great.
         I'd like to ask just 2 questions so that I can be 100% sure
         to give you an analysis that is laid out exactly the way you want."
   
 - Address the issue
 
     Eg. "I've noticed some difficulty in communicating my thoughts clearly.
         Would you mind sparing a few minutes to meet with me and help me understand
         how I can best communicate my thoughts to you."
         
     Eg. "I've reviewed your changes and suggestions.
         To ensure that this project moves forward smoothly,
         would you mind taking a few minutes to meet with me
         and share your expectations?"
