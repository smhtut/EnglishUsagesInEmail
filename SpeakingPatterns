Question
- Does it seem like ...?
- How are you getting on with your teaching practice at the high school?
- Have you been doing anything with them?
  (apart from practicing the music I mean)
- Can I tell you a few people in the band who I'm finding it quite difficult to cope with?
- Do you have any thought about what I can do, Lizzy?

Conversation
- I would like to talk it over with you.
  (to discuss a problem or situation)
  (often to find out their opinion)
- you better start by giving me a bit of background.

Statement
- I have been put in charge of the school marching band and it's quite a responsibility.
- Even if they don't win, I don't expect them too.
- Hopefully it'll be an incentive for them to try and improve.
- That's what I've got in mind.
- They sound like a good idea to me.
- One of the trombonists has got an impressive sense of rythm. He could be an excellent musician.
- He would be much better off playing percusion for instance but he refuse to give up.
- He always rushes off as soon as the rehearsal ends and he never seems to interact with other people. It isn't good in a band where people really need to feel they're part of a group.

Conclusion
- I would appreciate it if you could revert to my email very soon.
